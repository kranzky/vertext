# TODO

* Fix jerky scrolling when lots of anchor links are present.
* Add syntax highlighting for code blocks.
* Strip out HTML tags (this will need to use the markdown parser to make sure
  that we still allow HTML tags in code blocks, for example).
* Support just img and video tags?
* Get the file open dialog working for the web version.
* Make the web version open non-markdown links in a new tab.
* Allow :these: kinds of emojis to work.
* Implement a night mode.
* Implement themes (fonts, colours, sizes etc).
* Add a mode to show the table of contents, perhaps in a pop-out sidebar.
* Different column layout on mobile.
* Full UI redesign.
* Package for distribution and launch version 1.0.
